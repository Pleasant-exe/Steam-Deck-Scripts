# Steam Deck Scripts

Some scripts i made so that i dont need to re write commands every update.


## Unlock script

This script will unlock the Steam Deck root files after it has been re locked after an update.

### Instructons

Download and run the following commands (Make sure you have a password enabled for Root)

```bash
  cd /Downloads (Or wherever you chose to download it to)
  chmod +x unlock.sh
  ./unlock.sh
```

## Kvantum Manager
 
By default you can install Kvantum engine in discovery but you cannot install Kvantum Manager, this script makes it easy to enable it after every update

### Instructons

```bash
  cd /Downloads (Or wherever you chose to download it to)
  chmod +x kvantum.sh
  ./kvantum.sh
```
